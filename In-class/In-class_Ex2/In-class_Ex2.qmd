## Getting Started

### Loading the required packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, funModeling, sfdep)
```

## Importing geospatial data

### Importing water point geospatial data

The code chunk below imports water point data from geo_export and filters it to those in Nigera using filter().

```{r}
wp_nga <- read_rds("data/ngpoint_sf.rds")
```
